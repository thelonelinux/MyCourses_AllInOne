# Coding Blocks Homework Repository : Make Code Great Again!
A place where EveryOne will be adding their code.

---

## 1. What the hell just happenned? That's not the code we did in class?!  
Nothing Bad,Don't Worry . I just cleaned the code.Your machine won't blow up, I Promise :smile:    
All your PR attempts during the class has been merged  and they are present inside the  **[Git_Session](https://github.com/coding-blocks-archives/DwarkaAndroid2018Summer/tree/master/homework/Git_Session/attempts_classroom)** folder.  

## 2. Grr,  But it did. Just tell me quick, what to do!

 *  **Short-term, Bad hack** :
	* go to your profile page on github.com  
	* go to `your`  DwarkaAndroid2018Summer repo under the `repository`  button
	* settings > delete this archive (in the bottom) [ **Warning** : this will also delete 
	   all the local changes and would cause error in your offline repository    
	* `Fork` the  DwarkaAndroid2018Summer  repo again.    

 * **Long-Term, Good method** :    

	1.  **Sync CodingBlock's Repository with your `Online`  repository**.  : `make a Pull Request1`      
		(Where? on your  forked repository, _ there will be a line saying this branch is x commits behind main branch_ . the button is right there    
	2. **Sync your `Online` Repository with your  `Offline` Copy**  :    
		1. go inside your  `local/offline` copy. open  `bash` here .   
		2.  `git pull`

## 3. Meh,Ok . What's with this `Ansh_Sachdeva` Folder and Where are the other Github session Related Files?  
*  **[Git_Session](https://github.com/coding-blocks-archives/DwarkaAndroid2018Summer/tree/master/homework/Git_Session/attempts_classroom)**` You will find all the github related content(+more) in today's Session Here    

*  `Ansh_Sachdeva` : this is just a sample Repo . From now On You will be  creating a `Your_Name` folder just like this, and submit each week's challange/Homework inside that folder only. _**Note** :As discussed, Information related UI challange app that I showed in the class will be posted here by 21.6.18 mid night. Do keep a check :P_
