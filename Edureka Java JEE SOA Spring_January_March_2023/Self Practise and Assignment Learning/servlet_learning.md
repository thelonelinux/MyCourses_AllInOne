Here we will see how to make servlet project in Ubuntu in IntellijIdea Ultimate edition (Can't create servlets web project in community edition of intellijIdea).



Step 1 : Open IntellijIdea
Step 2 : Click on File, Create New Project, 
Step 3 : Subwindow Opens ups: Choose JAKARTA EE, In template choose "Web Application", Choose Maven only
Step 4 : If you have already configured TomCat Server then it's ok.

So these following 4 files will open up: 
Index.jsp (landing Page)
but you can change landing page by making html file with file name as 
Index.html

Rest there is servlet.java in src folders/package check there only (These are default files which we create)
